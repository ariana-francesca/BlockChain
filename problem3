Problem 3: Write a program that accepts two numbers as inputs. Your program should count the number of odd numbers in x and even numbers in y, and provide methods to display these counts.
Contract name: MyNumber
Sample output:
Input value for X: 17
Input value for Y: 16
Odd numbers for X: 9
Even numbers for Y:8
